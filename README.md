# Autonomous garden irrigation system based on the Internet of Things - ACTUATOR NODE
Autonomous garden irrigation system based on the Internet of Things, actuator node. This is part of my Bachelors degree thesis as well
as my personal portfolio. This actuator node's responsability is to read the value from the different sensors and send them to the 
controller node as well as execute the commands from the controller node. It was developed by Luis Espinosa Llanos and it was used 
the following technologies and tools:
